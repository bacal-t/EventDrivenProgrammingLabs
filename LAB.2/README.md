## Laboratory work Nr. 2

### Title : Advanced Form Elements. Child Windows. Basics of Working With Keyboard.

### Laboratory Work requirements

#### Mandatory Objectives:

- Display a dialog box on some event (ex. on clicking some button)
- Add a system menu to your application with at least 3 items (add actions to that items)
- Add a scroll bar that will change any visible parameter of any other element (color of a text)
- Hook keyboard input. Add 2 custom events for 2 different keyboard combinations (ex. change window background on ctrl+space)


#### Objectives with points

 - Add a listbox and attach some events when any element is accessed (clicked) (2 pt)
 - Add 2 scroll bars that will manage main window size or position
 - Customize your application by adding an icon and using different cursor in application (1 pt)
 - Use a scroll bar to scroll through application working space. Scroll should appear only when necessary (eg. when window width is smaller than 300px) (1 pt)

## Laboratory Work Implementation

### Result
After reading small part from Charles Pretzol Book about Windows Programming, like : Creating Menu, Multiple Windows, Scroll Bar ... that helped me to see how to implement everything in code and how our laboratory work has to look like.

- OwnerControl() helps to create buttons, textboxes
- With ScrollBar we can change color, move and change width, height.
- We have some windows for client like: Name, Surname, Age (to find more info about client).
- After we can click on "Add to list"
- We have button "Delete from list" which works when you choose one item in list and try to delete with a click on thst button.

Also we have some features like: 

- F3 (changes font)
- F2 (executes a message)
- F1 (Quit)



### Conclusion
In this laboratory work I got more skills operating with windows programming techniques and functions. I learned about functions to create Menu , scroll bars and another advanced features of buttons. I found this laboratory work very useful for increase the skills in Windows Programming.
