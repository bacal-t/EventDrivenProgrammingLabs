## Laboratory work Nr. 3

### Title : Basics of Working with Mouse. GDI Primitives. Bezier Curve.

### Laboratory Work requirements

#### Mandatory Objectives:

-  Draw few lines of different colors and weights
- Draw a Bezier curve
- Draw few plane objects (ex. circle, square, pie, polygon...) of different colors, weights, filled and not
- Draw 2 different objects using mouse

#### Objectives with points

 - Draw a custom bitmap image (1 pt)
 - Add a switch (button, select list...) that will change mouse ability to draw objects (2 pt)
 - Draw a Bezier curve using mouse (1 pt)
 - Fill an object with a gradient (1 pt)
 - Delete objects using mouse clicking (2 pt)
 - Use mouse as an eraser of:
  - a fixed width (1 pt).
  - a adjustable width (2 pt).
 - Zoom in and out application working area using keyboard (2 pt)
 
## Laboratory Work Implementation

### Result
Implemented in C#

 - The colored button on the top opens a Color Picker Dialog, where the user can change the pen color
 - In the width Combo Box you can change the line and eraser width
 - The shapes combo box, here you can choose what type of shape you want to use, so here you can find rectangle, line, ellipse, eraser and bezier curve (you can draw bezier curve with the mouse, it uses 4 points)
 - Clear button used for clearing the screen
 - Save button used for saving your image to a bitmap ;
 - You can zoom in and out by pressing "W" and "S"



### Conclusion
In this laboratory work I got more skills how to draw Bezier curves, to write to a bitmap image, to work with GDI primitives and to use Window Forms. Working with C# instead of C++ saved me a lot of time.
